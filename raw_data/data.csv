I may publish and/or present my findings during
conference presentations based on the conversations we have. I am going to ask you for
your intuitions about whether sentences sound natural in particular contexts. You can skip
questions that make you uncomfortable or that you don’t want to answer. Your participation
will consist of completing a ten- to twenty-minute questionnaire. You will receive
£3 for your participation. The general benefit of this project is an increased understanding
of understudied constructions in British English. If you decide that you do not want to
participate anymore, you will not lose any benefit or receive any penalty. Also, there is no
risk or discomfort in participating. All of the information taken will remain confidential.
Participation is voluntary and you may stop at any time without penalty or loss of benefits.

For example, the question referencing Game of Thrones does not state whether the mother actually KNOWS the father does not want the child to read more fantasy books.

If she knows then the appropriateness of the statement may drop somewhat.

Unless she knows and disagrees. In which case the appropriateness is unchanged.

Or, she may know and be making this statement somewhat tongue-in-cheek. That would be a very British thing to do, in this case.

Essentially, I often found I needed a bit more context to decide how appropriate the statements were. 

Another example is the woman saying ""I bet those kids are up to no good"". If she's saying this tongue-in-cheek (very British) then the appropriateness is higher than if she's being sincere.

Many of my answers would have been a bit more definitive with a bit more context. Although it occurs to me that you may have wanted me to add my own subtext as part of your research.

Oh, and that dad shouldn't have been taking his timid kid to see a horror film in the first place! The most appropriate thing for him to say afterwards would probably be ""I'm a terrible dad, aren't I?""

I possibly overthink things. A bit. Sorry."
