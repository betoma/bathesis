# BA Thesis OSU 2017
This repository will contain my undergraduate thesis (or will once I finish it :/) 

as well as the materials of the experiment, the dataset, and the R code for generating the figures (and maybe regression we'll see) in the paper: the file analysis.R contains the main code; it uses functions defined in helpers.R.
